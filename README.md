# Grafter Extra

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/grafter/extra.svg)](https://clojars.org/grafter/extra)

A library of tranformations and tools that can be used when developing grafter pipelines.

The functions provided here are useful enough to be re-used but haven't yet demonstrated that they deserve to enter the core grafter library.

See [grafter.org](http://grafter.org/) for more details.

NOTE: As of grafter-extra 0.3.0; the namespaces that depended upon incanter and the deprecated grafter.tabular library have been moved into a separate deprecated grafter.tabular-extra library.
